# COVID-19 Visualization in Tableau ( [View the Dashboard here](https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19_Data_Viz_2/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link))

This project is the continuation of "Covid-19 Data Exploration in SQL (using SSMS)" as we will be using the same dataset and some queries for Visualization in Tableau.

## DATA
Here, we'll run the required queries in SSMS and then export the results to separate tables which can later use for viz. with Tableau.

## REQUIREMENT
Visualize the following in Tableau:

    1. Death Count by Continent (Bar)

    2. Geographical Map showing the infection severity throughout the world.

    3. The infection trend of the following countries: China, India, Japan, South Korea, United Kingdom, United States. (Line)   

    4. Global data. (As a table)


## Project Pipeline

    1.	Query each requirement from the database that we had already created and save as separate tables.

    2.	Import these tables to Tableau and create our dashboard as per the requirement.
